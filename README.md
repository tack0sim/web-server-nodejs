# NOTE:
# Homebrew is not a Node.js package manager.
# Please ensure it is already installed on your system.
# Follow official instructions at https://brew.sh/
# Homebrew only supports installing major Node.js versions and might not support the latest Node.js version from the 22 release line.

# download and install Node.js
brew install node@22

# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print `v22.11.0`

# verifies the right npm version is in the environment
npm -v # should print `10.9.0`
```

Install successful!
